# DroPass - Automatically Encrypting Text File Editor

## Dependencies:
- Python 3+
- Cryptography (python module, you can install it via pip)

## How to use:
1. Decide on where your new encrypted file is to be stored
2. Once you have the path, enter it into the config as the program prompts you to. 
3. Choose a strong and secure master password which will be used to encrypt your file. MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT LOSE THIS AS IT WILL NOT BE STORED ANYWHERE!!! You should write it down since you will need to re-enter this password every time you wish you edit your file. 
4. You can then edit your file. Be sure to save before closing. 

## Keyboard shortcuts:
### - Ctrl-s to save file (file will be automatically encrypted with your master password when saved - plaintext will be deleted - gone -  once you close the editor)
### - Ctrl-q to close editor
